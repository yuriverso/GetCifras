(intro)
2x
Gb  Db  Absus  Ab,


(verse)
Gb        Db
 We drove right past
Absus    Ab
 That no trespassing sign
Gb            Db
 We sat on the tailgate
Absus            Ab
 And watched the planes take off


(verse)
Gb                     Db
 We thought we had all night
                     Absus
There was no need to rush
                  Ab
That's when those cops
             Gb
Came pulling up
    Db
And I thought
Absus                Ab
Man, ain't this some shhhh


(Chorus)
                   Gb      Db
Your daddy's gonna kill me
       Absus       Ab
But if I survive tonight
                  Gb        Db
I wouldn't change one thing
Absus                       Ab
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy
              Gb
But there was somethin bout the way
    Db
The blue lights were shinin
Absus                       Ab
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
      Gb
I was too busy watching you
Db
Going wild child
      Absus                  Ab 
To be worried about going to jail

You were thinking that
Gb
Running for it
Db
 Would make a good story
      Absus                      Ab
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
                Gb
And you were so Innocent
Db
 But you were stealing my heart
Absus                  Ab                Gb Db Absus Ab
 I fell in love in the back of a cop car


(verse)
Gb         Db
 Man, they weren't playin
Absus                  Ab
 They sure threw those cuffs on quick
Gb            Db
 You tried to sweet talk 'em
Absus        Ab
 They didn't fall for it, but I did
Gb               Db
 You were on the left
             Absus
I was on the right
                  Ab
I knew you didn't smoke
         Gb
When you asked him for a light
    Db
And I laughed
   Absus               Ab
He got mad and slammed the door


(Chorus)
                   Gb      Db
Your daddy's gonna kill me
       Absus       Ab
But if I survive tonight
                  Gb        Db
I wouldn't change one thing
Absus                       Ab
Baby, yeah I know it sounds crazy
              Gb
But there was somethin bout the way
    Db
The blue lights were shinin
Absus                       Ab

(instrumental-bridge)
Gb     Db     Absus  Ab, 
(oh oh oh ooh)          oh, and you were like
Gb  Db  Absus  Ab
(oh oh oh ooh)

(no chord)
Side by side

And locked in tight

They were taking their time

But we didn't mind

We talked

And we laughed

We sat real close

By the time they let us go
              Gb   Db
I was already gone

(instrumental)
Absus  Ab, Gb  Db  Absus  Ab


(chorus-out)
              Gb
But there was somethin bout the way
    Db
The blue lights were shinin
Absus                       Ab
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
      Gb

Absus                  Ab                 Gb    Db   Absus Ab

         Gb 
Oh, and side by side
